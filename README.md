## Introduction

The **Sensor_Lib** library simplifies the process of measuring and controlling sensors. It allows developers to focus on their projects without worrying about the complexities of sensor calibration and control. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this library provides the tools you need to get started quickly.

For the latest releases, visit [this link](https://github.com/Ankur11211/Sensor_Lib/releases). You can download the necessary files from there and execute them to start using the library.

## Features

- **Easy to Use**: The library offers straightforward functions that make it easy to integrate sensors into your projects.
- **Wide Compatibility**: Works with popular microcontrollers such as Arduino, ESP32, and NodeMCU.
- **Sensor Calibration**: Built-in functions to calibrate sensors for accurate measurements.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear instructions and examples for each function.
- **Community Support**: Join a growing community of developers using the library.

## Installation

To install the **Sensor_Lib**, follow these steps:

1. Download the library from the [Releases section](https://github.com/Ankur11211/Sensor_Lib/releases).
2. Extract the downloaded files.
3. Move the extracted folder to your Arduino libraries directory, typically located at `Documents/Arduino/libraries/`.
4. Restart the Arduino IDE.

Once installed, you can start using the library in your projects.

## Usage

Using the **Sensor_Lib** is simple. Hereâ€™s a quick guide on how to include the library and use its functions.

1. Include the library in your Arduino sketch:

   ```cpp
   #include <Sensor_Lib.h>
   ```

2. Initialize the sensor in the `setup()` function:

   ```cpp
   void setup() {
       Serial.begin(9600);
       Sensor_Lib sensor;
       sensor.begin();
   }
   ```

3. Use the library functions to read sensor data:

   ```cpp
   void loop() {
       float value = sensor.readValue();
       Serial.println(value);
       delay(1000);
   }
   ```

This example shows how to read a value from a sensor every second. The library handles the details, allowing you to focus on your project.

## Supported Sensors and Components

The **Sensor_Lib** supports a variety of sensors and components. Here are some of the most commonly used:

- **Temperature Sensors**: DHT11, DHT22, LM35
- **Humidity Sensors**: DHT11, DHT22
- **Light Sensors**: LDR, BH1750
- **Distance Sensors**: HC-SR04, VL53L0X
- **Pressure Sensors**: BMP180, BMP280
- **Motion Sensors**: PIR, MPU6050

This list is not exhaustive. Check the documentation for more details on supported sensors.

## Examples

The library comes with several examples to help you get started. You can find these examples in the `examples` folder within the library directory. Here are a few highlighted examples:

### Temperature and Humidity Monitoring

This example shows how to read temperature and humidity data using a DHT sensor.

```cpp
#include <Sensor_Lib.h>

Sensor_Lib dht;

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    dht.begin();
}

void loop() {
    float temperature = dht.readTemperature();
    float humidity = dht.readHumidity();
    Serial.print("Temperature: ");
    Serial.print(temperature);
    Serial.print(" Â°C, Humidity: ");
    Serial.print(humidity);
    Serial.println(" %");
    delay(2000);
}
```

### Light Level Measurement

Use this example to measure light levels with an LDR.

```cpp
#include <Sensor_Lib.h>

Sensor_Lib ldr;

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    ldr.begin();
}

void loop() {
    int lightLevel = ldr.readLightLevel();
    Serial.print("Light Level: ");
    Serial.println(lightLevel);
    delay(1000);
}
```

These examples demonstrate the ease of use and flexibility of the **Sensor_Lib**.
